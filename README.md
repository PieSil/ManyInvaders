# ManyInvaders

*ManyInvaders* is a simple video game I developed for the *Image Processing and Computer Vision* course at the Politecnico di Torino.
It's a tower defense game where the interaction is entirely based on hand gestures.

Aim at your enemies with your finger, do the "gun" hand gesture and eliminate them before they reach you!
