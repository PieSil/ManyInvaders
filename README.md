# ManyInvaders

**ManyInvaders** is a dynamic and innovative video game I created as part of the *Image Processing and Computer Vision* course at *Politecnico di Torino*. This tower defense game takes interaction to the next level by relying entirely on hand gestures for control.

Take aim at your enemies with a simple finger point, form a "gun" gesture with your hand, and shoot them down before they reach you!
